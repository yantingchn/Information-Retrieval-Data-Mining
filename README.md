# Information-Retrieval-Data-Mining
These topics are part of Information Retrieval and Data Mining (COMP0084) module undertaken at UCL.
### Coursework 1: Passage Re-ranking
**Goal:** Build a passage re-ranking system with different query likelihood language models such as Laplace smoothing, Lidstone correction, Dirichlet smoothing ... etc.

### Coursework 2: Learning to Rank (LTR)
**Goal:** Create an advanced information retrieval model that addresses the challenge of passage retrieval. Specifically, we aim to develop a model that can efficiently and accurately provide a prioritized list of passages that are relevant to a given query.
